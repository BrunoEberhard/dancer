= A Minimal-J application

This application lists the dance events in my region. There wasn't such a list for my favorite dance style
so I decided to do one on my own. The application should crawl the web site of the locations and look for the dates of the
coming events. Most of the data should be collected in this way but I still wanted to have a admin UI to change specific dates
if the crawler did something wrong. The data should be kept in a small database.

The running application can be found at https://www.flotte-sohle.ch/ .
This is also an example application for link:http://www.minimal-j.org/[Minimal-J] . See link:doc/dev_guide.adoc[dev guide].
